# British-Airways-Virtual-Internship

I've completed the British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Programme!

This program was a great opportunity to learn about the different ways that data science can be used to improve business decisions. I completed tasks in web scraping to gain company insights and predicting customer buying behavior.

For the web scraping task, I used BeautifulSoup to extract customer review data from the British Airways website. I then analyzed this data to identify trends in customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction. This information could be used by British Airways to improve its customer service and product offerings.

For the customer buying behavior task, I built a predictive model using machine learning algorithms. This model could be used to predict which customers are most likely to book a flight with British Airways. This information could be used by British Airways to target its marketing campaigns more effectively.

Here are some of the things I learned from the program:

How to use web scraping to extract data from websites
How to analyze data to identify trends
How to build predictive models using machine learning algorithms
How to apply data science to real-world business problems
